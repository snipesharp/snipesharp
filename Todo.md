# List of ideas/bug fixes to be implemented:
## Automatic offset before name drop
Implement option to leave the offset input empty to determine the offset right before name drop 
## Multiple name lists
For each json file that contains "names" in it's name, count it as a name list
## Multiple Accounts support
After successfully sniping a name, switch to another account since the current one can't change it's name again for the next 30 days
